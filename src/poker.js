// Input: 2 arrays of strings, each with 2 items.
//Output: 1 array.

// Check if both items in an array are the same
// If they are, it's a pair.
// If not, it's not a pair.
// If neither of the arrays has a pair, return []
// If one of the arrays has a pair, return that pair

// If both of the arrays have pairs, figure out which pair scores higher
// Check every card in one of the arrays against some kind of point value
// ['J', 'Q'] -> look at 'J', {'J': 11}, look at 'Q', {'Q': 12}
// Do that for both arrays, compare the total score
// Then return the array with the highest score.
